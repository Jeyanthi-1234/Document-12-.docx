Literature Survey
A literature survey is a method of researching existing literature and studies related to a specific topic. In the context of ‘Tracing the growth of a global community’ a literature survey would involve reviewing studies and articles that have been published on the topic of population and  demographics, as well as studies specific population increase in cities,The literature survey would include sources such as academic journals, industry reports, and online articles. It would aim to identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
Literature review 
According to optimists like Keynes, development in a country without population growth will cause 
problems. When the population increases, they expect the savings and investments also to increase. 
When the population decreases, the production, capital accumulation, employment, incomes and 
savings will also decrease and may negatively affect the development. According to Keynes, the 
growth of population will cause a strong demand for goods that will make it possible to establish a 
good market as well as increase the demand for capital. Optimists like Arthur Lewis (1954) and 
Jorgenson (1961) have declared that population growth will speed up economic development. 
Boserup (1981) says that using improved technology can have a positive impact on production. Some 
demographers have concluded that slower population growth would be beneficial for development in 
most developing countries and that the relationship between population and development is contextual 
(The National Research Council, 1986). The study by Kelly and Schmidt (1995) has also concluded 
that population size and density have a transitional impact on economic growth. Other studies have 
reported that the shift in age distribution pattern has had a significant impact on economic growth 
through savings and investments (Mason, 1988; Bloom and Williamson, 1997).
According to Bloom and Canning, "There is strong evidence that demographic change has a major 
impact on the course of economic growth. For example, they say rising life expectancy tends to 
increase savings and education level, increasing the investment in physical and human capital"(Bloom 
and Canning, 1999). Coale and Hoover have expressed their views about the relationship between 
population growth and economic growth. According to them, an economy based on agriculture shows 
high mortality and fertility rates (Coaleand Hoover, 1958). Generally, due to disasters and floods, the 
rate of mortality is high in this field. On account of poor nutrition, bad health habits, limited public 
health programs and inadequate sanitary facilities, the mortality rate will be at a high level. However, 
countries that change over from agricultural products to industrial and technological products will 
increase their production capacity and thus improve their economy (Coaleand Hoover, 1958). 
Livingston (2002)mentions that Malthus and neo-Malthusians believe that population growth is 
negatively correlated with economic growth. But Julian Simon argues that the correlation is positive. 
According to Simon (1977), the newer generation of job-seekers who enter the workforce will have 
better education than the previous generation of workers, and so the former will be more productive 
than the latter, leading to greater economic development.
